#: name: Table 1
#: description: The measured inclusive jet double-differential cross section in the rapidity bin |y| < 0.3 for anti-kt jets with R = 0.4 as a function of the jet PT. The first (sys) error is the combined correlated systematic error and the second the combined uncorrelated systematic error,excluding the luminosity uncertainty. Also shown are the multiplicative non-perturbative corrections,NPcorr.
